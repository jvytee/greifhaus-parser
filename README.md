## Development
It is strongy recommended to use a virtual environment for development of this project:

    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

After that, this repo can be installed as a python package in editable mode:

    pip install -e .

There is no need to reinstall the package after its source code has been changed;
altered setuptools configuration such as changes to the list of dependencies will not be applied automatically however.

Successful setup can be verified by the availability of `gymscraper` on path (in the virtual environment).
